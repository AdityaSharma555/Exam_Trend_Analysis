# Exam_Trend_Analysis
The Exam Trend Analysis project aims to conduct a comprehensive examination of historical exam data to show  key findings and insights derived from the data using data visualizations (graphs, charts, etc.) that represent exam performance trends and subject-specific analyses, and identify trends and success factors.

The dataset used here is a generated sample, using specific parameters, and does not correspond to any real life data.
